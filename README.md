The DATA MINING CUP (DMC for short) has inspired students around the world to pursue intelligent data analysis since the year 2000. For more info [click here](https://www.data-mining-cup.com/).

## Data Mining Cup 2021 - Scenario

Before the pandemic, Johannes Gutenberg managed a flourishing little book shop in the historic city center of Mainz. He took great joy in building personal relationships with each of his clients, recommending books catered to their personal taste and assisting in widening their literary palette. In his city and beyond he developed a formidable reputation with a respectable base of loyal customers, who considered him more of a connoisseur than a traditional salesman.

Unfortunately, this loyal base of customers is not enough to make his business profitable. And so, like many traditional retailers, Johannes also relies on walk-in customers. At the beginning of the pandemic, this source of revenue vanished. To keep his employees and cover ongoing costs, Johannes had to find an alternative form of revenue. With great initial reservation, he decided to expand his business by launching an online shop, which he believed would save his beloved business from imminent bankruptcy. At first, Johannes and his employees tried their best to provide suitable recommendations for every product manually. But as the number of products increased and associates worked to keep at least some personal contact to clients via phone and email, this manual process was just not feasible.

Today, Johannes is looking for a reliable recommendation system to provide a targeted recommendation to every product page. This solution should meet his high personalization standards and only require a small amount of manual support to implement.
